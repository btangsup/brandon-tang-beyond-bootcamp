            <h2>Codenames rules: how to play</h2>
            <h3>Objective: To be the winning team that has their code master correctly guess all of their respective colours! </h3>
            <ol class="rules">
                <li>Divide the players into two teams (blue and red) and select one person to be the "codemaster"</li>
                <li>Each team's codemaster must click on the codemaster button to reveal the code names set up and will show their respective coloured words they need to score, as well as the neutral words and death card(if this card is selected the game is over immediately and the opposing team wins)</li>
                <li>Whoever has more words to guess at the start will proceed to giving a ONE word clue to associate with however many words they can relate to.</li>
                <li>Clues given cannot be onomatopoeia, words that rhyme with their coloured words as well</li>
                <li>If a neutral card is selected, the turn is over immediately and the other team gets to start</li>
                <li>Game is over once all of their respective cards are chosen. GL HF!</li>
